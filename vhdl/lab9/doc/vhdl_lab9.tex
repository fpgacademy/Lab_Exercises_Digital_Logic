\centerline{\large A Simple Processor}
~\\
~\\
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} shows a digital system that contains a number of 16-bit registers,
a multiplexer, an adder/subtracter, and a control unit (finite state machine).  Information
is input to this system via the 16-bit {\it DIN} input, which is loaded into the {\it IR} 
register. Data can be transferred through the 16-bit wide multiplexer from one register
in the system to another, such as from register {\it IR} into one of the {\it general 
purpose} registers $r0, \ldots, r7$.  The multiplexer's output is called {\it Buswires} 
in the figure because the term {\it bus} is often used for wiring that allows data to be 
transferred from one location in a system to another. The FSM controls the {\it Select} 
lines of the multiplexer, which allows any of its inputs to be transferred to any register
that is connected to the bus wires.

~\\
The system can perform different operations in each clock cycle, as governed by the FSM. 
It determines when particular data is placed onto the bus wires and controls which of the 
registers is to be loaded with this data. For example, if the FSM selects $r0$ as the output of the 
bus multiplexer and also asserts $A_{in}$, then the contents of register $r0$ will be loaded on the 
next active clock edge into register {\it A}.

~\\
Addition or subtraction of signed numbers is performed by using the multiplexer to first 
place one 16-bit number onto the bus wires, and then loading this number into register {\it A}. 
Once this is done, a second 16-bit number is placed onto the bus, the adder/subtracter
performs the required operation, and the result is loaded into register {\it G}. The
data in {\it G} can then be transferred via the multiplexer to one of the other registers,
as required.

\noindent
A system like the one in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} is often called a {\it processor}. It 
executes operations specified in the 
form of {\it instructions}. Table~\ref{tab:instructions} lists the instructions that this 
processor supports. The left column shows the name of an instruction and its operands. 
The meaning of the syntax {\it rX} $\leftarrow$ {\it Op2} is that the second operand,
{\it Op2}, is loaded into register {\it rX}. The operand {\it Op2} can be either a
register, {\it rY}, or {\it immediate data}, \#{\it D}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl|c}
   \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Instruction} & Function performed \\ \hline 
   \rule[0.01in]{0in}{0.15in}{\it mv} & {\it rX}, $Op2$ & {\it rX} $\leftarrow Op2$ \\ 
		  \rule[-0.075in]{0in}{0.2in}{\it mvt} & {\it rX,} \#{\it D} & {\it rX$_{15-8}$}
          $\leftarrow$ {\it D$_{7-0}$}\\ 
   \rule[-0.075in]{0in}{0.2in}{\it add} & {\it rX}, $Op2$ & {\it rX} $\leftarrow$ {\it rX} + $Op2$ \\ 
   \rule[-0.075in]{0in}{0.2in}{\it sub} & {\it rX}, $Op2$ & {\it rX} $\leftarrow$ {\it rX} $-$ $Op2$ \\ 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Instructions performed in the processor.}
\label{tab:instructions}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent
Instructions are loaded from the external input {\it DIN}, and stored into the {\it IR} register, 
using the connection indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}. Each instruction is {\it encoded} using 
a 16-bit format. If $Op2$ specifies a register, then the instruction encoding is 
\texttt{III0XXX000000YYY}, where \texttt{III} specifies the instruction, \texttt{XXX} gives 
the {\it rX} register, and \texttt{YYY} gives the {\it rY} register. If $Op2$ specifies 
immediate data \#{\it D}, then the encoding is \texttt{III1XXXDDDDDDDDD}, where the field 
\texttt{DDDDDDDDD} represents a nine-bit {\it signed} (2's complement) value. Although 
only two bits are needed to encode our four instructions, we are using three bits because 
other instructions will be added to the processor later. Assume that \texttt{III} $= 000$ for
the {\it mv} instruction, $001$ for {\it mvt}, $010$ for {\it add}, and $011$ for {\it sub}. 

~\\
The {\it mv} instruction ({\it move}) copies the contents of one register into 
another, using the syntax \texttt{mv} \texttt{rX,rY}. It can also be used to initialize a 
register with immediate data, as in \texttt{mv} \texttt{rX,\#D}.  Since the data {\it D} 
is represented inside the encoded instruction using only nine bits, the processor has to 
{\it sign-extend} the data, as in \texttt{$D_8D_8D_8D_8D_8D_8D_8$$D_{8-0}$}, before loading it into 
register~{\it rX}.  The {\it mvt} instruction ({\it move top}) is used to initialize the 
most-significant byte of a register.  The instruction \texttt{mvt} \texttt{rX,\#D} 
loads the 16-bit value 
\texttt{D$_{7-0}$00000000} into {\it rX}. As an example, to load register $r0$ with the 
value \texttt{0xFF00}, you would use the instruction \texttt{mvt r0,\#0xFF}. The instruction 
\texttt{add} \texttt{rX,rY} produces the sum {\it rX} $+$ {\it rY} and loads the result 
into {\it rX}. The instruction \texttt{add} \texttt{rX,\#D} produces the 
sum {\it rX} $+$ {\it D}, where {\it D} is sign-extended to 16 bits, and saves the result 
in {\it rX}. The {\it sub} instruction generates 
either {\it rX} $-$ {\it rY}, or {\it rX} $-$ \#{\it D} and loads the result into {\it rX}.

~\\
Some instructions, such as an {\it add} or {\it sub}, take a few clock cycles to complete, 
because multiple transfers have to be performed across the bus. The finite state machine in the 
processor ``steps through'' such instructions, asserting the control signals needed in 
successive clock cycles until the instruction has completed.  The processor starts executing 
the instruction on the {\it DIN} input when the {\it Run} signal is asserted and the processor 
asserts the {\it Done} output when the instruction is finished.  Table~\ref{tab:control_signals}
indicates the control signals from Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} that have to be 
asserted in each time step to implement the instructions in Table~\ref{tab:instructions}.  The 
only control signal asserted in time step $T_0$, for all instructions, is {\it IR}$_{in}$. 
The meaning of {\it Select rY} or {\it IR} in the table is that the multiplexer selects 
and puts onto the bus ({\it BusWires}) either the contents of register {\it rY} or the immediate 
data in {\it IR}, depending on the value of $Op2$.
For the {\it mv} instruction, when {\it IR} is selected the multiplexer outputs 
\texttt{DDDDDDDDD} sign-extended to 16 bits,
and for {\it mvt} the multiplexer outputs \texttt{DDDDDDDD00000000}.
Only signals from Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} that have to be asserted in each time 
step are listed in Table~\ref{tab:instructions}; all other signals are not asserted. The 
meaning of {\it AddSub} in step $T_2$ of the {\it sub} instruction is that this signal is set 
to 1, and this setting causes the adder/subtracter unit to perform subtraction using 
2's-complement arithmetic.

~\\
The processor in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} can perform various tasks by using a sequence of 
instructions. For example, the sequence below loads the number 28 into register $r0$ and then 
calculates, in register $r1$, the 2's complement value $-28$.

\begin{minipage}[t]{15 cm}
\begin{lstlisting}
       mv    r0, #28        // original number = 28
       mvt   r1, #0xFF
       add   r1, #0xFF      // r1 = 0xFFFF
       sub   r1, r0         // r1 = 1's-complement of r0
       add   r1, #1         // r1 = 2's-complement of r0 = -28
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

~\\
This sequence of instructions produces the same result as the single instruction
\texttt{mv  r1,\#-28}.

\item Set up the required subfolder and files so that your VHDL code can be compiled and 
simulated using the Questa or ModelSim Simulator to verify that your processor works properly. 
An example simulation result for a correctly-designed circuit 
is given in Figure~\ref{fig:fig3}.  It shows the value \texttt{0x101C} being loaded into {\it IR} 
from {\it DIN} at time 30 ns. This pattern represents the instruction \texttt{mv r0,\#28}, 
where the immediate value $D = 28$ (\texttt{0x1C}) is loaded into $r0$ on the clock edge at 50 ns. 
The simulation results then show the instruction \texttt{mvt~r1,\#0xFF} at 70 ns, 
\texttt{add r0,\#0xFF} starting at 110 ns, and \texttt{sub r1,r0} starting at 190 ns.

You should perform a thorough simulation of your processor. A 
sample VHDL testbench file, {\it testbench.vht}, execution script, {\it testbench.tcl}, 
and waveform file, {\it wave.do} are provided along with this exercise.

\section*{Part II}
\addcontentsline{toc}{2}{Part II}
In this part we will design the circuit illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fig4}, in which a 
memory module and counter are connected to the processor. The
counter is used to read the contents of successive locations in the memory, and
this data is provided to the processor as a stream of instructions. To simplify the
design and testing of this circuit we have used separate clock signals, {\it PClock} 
and {\it MClock}, for the processor and memory. 

~\\
You are to implement the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:fig4} in a suitable FPGA (for example, 
the DE1-SoC, DE10-Standard, or DE10-Lite) board. As part of the process for designing and 
debugging the circuit, you must use the Questa or ModelSim simulator to test your 
VHDL code's functionality. Also, you can use the DESim tool as a way of 
observing how your circuit will behave on an FPGA board, even if you do not have access to 
a physical board (for example, at home). You are encouraged to make use of the
DESim tool to help in the design and debug of your VHDL code. This tool is available
from \texttt{FPGAcademy.org}. To make it easy to use the DESim tool, the design files for 
this part of the exercise include all required DESim setup files. Perform the following steps:

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A sample top-level VHDL file that instantiates the processor, memory module, and
counter is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:procmem}. This code is provided, along with this exercise,
in a file named {\it part2.vhd}.  The code instantiates a memory module called {\it inst\_mem}. 
A diagram of this memory module is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:fig_ROM}.
Since this module has only a read port, and no write port, it is called a {\it synchronous 
read-only memory (synchronous ROM)}. The memory module includes a register for 
synchronously loading addresses. This register is required due to the design of the memory 
resources in the Intel FPGA chip. 

The synchronous ROM is defined in a VHDL source-code file named 
{\it inst\_mem.vhd}, which is provided
along with this exercise. You can use the provided file, or you can create one yourself 
(if you want to see how this is done) by using the Quartus Prime software. The instructions for 
creating the {\it inst\_mem.vhd} file using the Quartus software are given below. If you do 
not wish to perform these steps, and just want to make use of the provided file, then 
skip to item \ref{item:mif}, below.

which is found under the {\sf Basic Functions $>$  On Chip Memory} category.  
Select {\sf VHDL} as the type of output file to create, and give the file the name 
{\it inst\_mem.vhd}.

Follow through the provided dialogue to create a memory that has one 16-bit 
wide read data port and is 32 words deep. Figures~\ref{fig:fig7} and ~\ref{fig:fig8} show the 
relevant pages and how to properly configure the memory. In Figure~\ref{fig:fig8},
under \texttt{Which ports should be registered?}, ensure that the \texttt{`q' output port}
is {\it not} selected. To place processor instructions into the memory, you need to specify 
{\it initial values} for the memory.
This can be done by initializing the memory using the contents of a {\it memory initialization 
file (MIF)}. The appropriate screen is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fig9}. We have specified 
a file named {\it inst\_mem.mif}, which then has to be created in the folder that 
contains the Quartus project. Clicking \texttt{Next} two more times will advance to the
\texttt{Summary} screen, which lists the names of files that will be created for the memory IP.
You should select {\it only} the VHDL file {\it inst\_mem.vhd}. Make sure that none of the 
other types of files are selected, and then click \texttt{Finish}.

\item
\label{item:mif} As described above, you need to provide a memory initialization file (MIF) called
{\it inst\_mem.mif} to specify the contents of the ROM. 
An example of a memory initialization file is given in 
Figure~\ref{fig:fig_MIF}. Note that comments (\% $\ldots$ \%) are included in this file as a way of
documenting the meaning of the provided instructions.  Set the contents of
your \texttt{MIF} file such that it provides enough processor instructions to test your circuit.

\item The VHDL code in Figure~\ref{fig:procmem} includes the appropriate 
port names for implementation of the design on an FPGA board, like the DE1-SoC.
The switch {\it SW}$_{9}$ drives the processor's {\it Run} input, {\it SW}$_0$ is
connected to {\it Resetn}, {\it KEY}$_0$ to {\it MClock}, and {\it KEY}$_1$ to {\it PClock}.
The Run signal is displayed on {\it LEDR}$_{9}$ and {\it Done} is connected to {\it LEDR}$_{0}$.

\end{figure}

\item Use the Questa or ModelSim Simulator to test your VHDL code. Ensure 
that instructions are read properly out of the ROM and executed by the processor. An example 
of simulation results with the MIF file from 
Figure~\ref{fig:fig_MIF} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fig_sim2}. The corresponding Simulator 
setup files are provided along with this exercise.
\item Once your simulations show a properly-working circuit, you should implement
your design on a DE1-SoC (or similar) board. Use the Quartus project files that are 
provided along with this exercise to compile your VHDL code with the Quartus Prime 
software, and then download the resulting circuit to the board.

Demonstrate the functionality of your circuit by
toggling the switches on the board and observing the LEDs. Since the circuit's clock inputs 
are controlled by pushbutton switches, it is possible to step through the execution of 
instructions and observe the behavior of the circuit.

\section*{Enhanced Processor}
\addcontentsline{toc}{3}{Enhanced Processor}
You can enhance your processor so that the counter in 
Figure~\ref{fig:fig4} is no longer needed, and so that the processor has the ability to 
perform read and write operations using memory or other devices. These enhancements involve 
adding new instructions to the processor, as well as other capabilities---they are
discussed in the next lab exercise.

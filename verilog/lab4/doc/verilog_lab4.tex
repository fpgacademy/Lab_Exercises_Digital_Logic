The purpose of this exercise is to build and use counters. The designed circuits are to be
implemented on an Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} FPGA DE10-Lite, DE0-CV, DE1-SoC, or DE2-115 Board.

Students are expected to have a basic understanding of counters and sufficient familiarity
with the Verilog hardware description language to implement various types of latches and flip-flops.

\section*{Part I}
\addcontentsline{toc}{1}{Part I}
Consider the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:asynchronous_counter}. It is a 4-bit synchronous 
counter which uses four
T-type flip-flops. The counter increments its value on each positive edge of the clock signal
if the {\it Enable} signal is high. The counter is reset to 0 on the next positive
clock edge if the synchronous {\it Clear} input is low.
You are to implement an 8-bit counter of this type.

\label{fig:asynchronous_counter}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a Verilog file that defines an 8-bit counter by using the structure
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:asynchronous_counter}. Your code should include a T 
flip-flop module that is instantiated
eight times to create the counter. Compile the circuit. How many logic elements (LEs) are 
used to implement your circuit? 
\item Simulate your circuit to verify its correctness.
\item Augment your Verilog file to use the pushbutton {\it KEY}$_0$ as the {\it Clock}
input and switches $SW_1$ and $SW_0$ as {\it Enable} and {\it Clear} inputs, and
7-segment displays {\it HEX1-0} to display the hexadecimal count as your circuit
operates. Make the necessary pin assignments needed to implement the circuit on your
DE-series board, and compile the circuit.
\item Download your circuit into the FPGA chip and test its functionality by operating
the switches.
\item Implement a four-bit version of your circuit and use the Quartus\textsuperscript{\textregistered} RTL Viewer to
see how the Quartus software synthesized the circuit. What are the differences in
comparison with Figure~\ref{fig:asynchronous_counter}?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Part II}

Another way to specify a counter is by using a register and adding 1 to its value. 
This can be accomplished using the following Verilog statement:
$$
{\rm Q <= Q + 1;}
$$
\noindent
Compile a 16-bit version of this counter and determine the number of LEs needed.  Use the RTL 
Viewer to see the structure of this implementation and comment on the differences with the 
design from Part I. Implement the counter on your DE-series board, using the displays 
{\it HEX3-0} to show the counter value.

\section*{Part III}
\addcontentsline{toc}{4}{Part III}
Design and implement a circuit that successively flashes digits 0 
through 9 on the 7-segment display {\it HEX0}. Each digit should be 
displayed for about one second. Use a counter to determine the one-second 
intervals. The counter should be incremented by the 50-MHz clock signal 
provided on the DE-series boards. Do not derive any other clock signals in your design--make 
sure that all flip-flops in your circuit are clocked directly by the 50-MHz clock signal.
A partial design of the required circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hint}. The figure
shows how a large bit-width counter can be used to produce an enable signal for a smaller
counter. The rate at which the smaller counter increments can be controlled by choosing an
appropriate number of bits in the larger counter.

\section*{Part IV}
\addcontentsline{toc}{5}{Part IV}
Design and implement a circuit that displays a word on four 7-segment displays {\it HEX}$3-0$.
The word to be displayed for your DE-series board is given in Table~\ref{tab:word}.
Make the letters rotate from right to left in intervals of about one second.
The rotating pattern for the DE10-Lite is given in Table~\ref{tab:rotate}.
If you are using the DE0-CV, DE1-SoC, or DE2-115, use the word given in Table~\ref{tab:word}.
There are many ways to design the required circuit. One solution is to re-use the Verilog code 
designed in Laboratory Exercise 1, Part V. Using that code, the main change needed is to 
replace the two switches that are used to select the characters being rotated on the displays
with a 2-bit counter that increments at one-second intervals.

\section*{Part V}
\addcontentsline{toc}{6}{Part V}
Augment your circuit from Part IV so that it can rotate the word over all of the
7-segment displays on your DE-series board. The shifting pattern for the DE10-Lite is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:rotate2}.
